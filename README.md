## TODO

Lots left to do, but this initial proof of concept is already useful to me!

- [ ] Add command line argument for loading/connecting to the database.
- [ ] Add converters to handle the various column data types (don't just use str() for everything). Will include maximum column width.
- [ ] Package for PyPI.
- [ ] Add a toggled pane for showing table metadata.
- [ ] Add command for sorting table data by selected column.
